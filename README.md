## Why ?
I want to improve in logical programming since I find i'm pretty bad at it. When I see poeple doing this really fast it makes me wanna do it too.\
This repo is made for keep track of my progression and solutions of the **[leetcode][leetcodew]** problems i find.

## What can you find
They can be the daily or any problem I find intresting or not. \
I hope I will add an explaination for all the problems but I don't have the time and patience to do it. Some of the problems aren't finished or not started because sometime I mess with the C features, try to make my life easier etc...

## What for the future ?
In the long run I want to make a little C library to make tests and code more efficiently. I always try to do that. I'm already working on it, maybe i will post it here...
